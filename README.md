# doi_retriever
The script "doi.py" retrieves the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) code of a list of scientific publications from the Crossref repository (habanero package). The references to these publications must be formatted in BibText. 

An example of a list of BibTex references is contained in the file "bibtext.csv"

This does not want to be a Python package or a professionally-written code, but a quick-and-dirt solution that I have implemented to quickly retrieve the DOIs of several publications. As I struggled to understand the documentation of the habanero package, I thought to publish this code to give a little help.
